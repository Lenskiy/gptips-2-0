# gptips v2.0
Symbolic XAI explainable machine learning &amp; non-linear regression platform for MATLAB
Version 2.0 (22nd May 2015)

Contains the **Hypothesis-ML** engine for using ML to build models (version 2.0). This module just not require any additional MATLAB toolboxes.

Contains the **Sym-XAI** explainable AI module for interpreting and visualising models and also for simplifying and exporting non-linear regression models (version 2.0). This module requires the additional MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox.

The Sym-XAI module components are for use with MATLAB versions up to and including R2017b.

At time of writing, you will get Symbolic Math toolbox errors in MATLAB versions R2018a and above if you use the v2.0 Sym-XAI module. This is due to recent major changes in MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox.
